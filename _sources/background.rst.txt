Background
==========

The catalog builder project is a “python community package ecosystem” that allows you to generate data catalogs compatible with intake-esm.  Available as a Conda package. 

See our `Github repository here <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder>`_.
We have contributing guidelines and code of conduct documented in our GitHub repo. We welcome your contributions. 

Brief overview on data catalogs 
-------------------------------

Data catalogs enable "data discoverability" regardless of the data format (zarr, netcdf). We acknowledge the different community collaborations (`Pangeo/ESGF Cloud Data working group <https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/>`_) that led us to explore this further. 

Data catalogs in this project have 3 components. One of those is the "intake-esm" API that makes use of the specifications and catalogs, generated by the catalog builder API. Read more about `Intake-ESM here <https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

Catalog Specification

- What we expect to find inside and how to open the “datasets”/objects? 
- Provides metadata about the catalog
- Identifies how multiple files can be aggregated into a single “dataset”
- Support for extensible metadata
- Single JSON file

Catalogs 

- Tells us more about the data collection 
- Path to the files (objects),  and associated metadata.
- CSV file
- User-defined granularity

Intake-ESM API

- Opens possibilities to QUERY and ANALYZE
- Provides a pythonic way to “query” for information in the catalogs
- Loads the results in an xarray dataset object
