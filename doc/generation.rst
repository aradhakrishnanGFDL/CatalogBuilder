Generating data catalogs
========================

There are a few ways to use the catalog builder.

Installation
------------

Recommended approach: Install as a `conda package <https://anaconda.org/NOAA-GFDL/intakebuilder>`_

.. code-block:: console

  conda install intakebuilder -c noaa-gfdl

Alternatively, you may clone the `git repository <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder.git>`_
and create your conda environment using the `environment.yml <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder/blob/main/environment.yml>`_ in the git repository. 

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder.git

   conda env create -f environment_intake.yml 

Expected output
---------------

A JSON catalog specification file and a CSV catalog in the specfied output directory with the specified name. 

Using conda package
-------------------

**1. Install the package using conda:** 

.. code-block:: console

  conda install intakebuilder -c noaa-gfdl

This package contains all dependencies needed to run the catalog builder.

**2. Add conda environment's site packages to PATH**

   See example below.

.. code-block:: console

   setenv PATH ${PATH}:${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/python3.1/site-packages/scripts/

**3. Call the builder** 

Catalogs are generated by the following command:  *gen_intake_gfdl.py <INPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>*

Output path argumment should end with the desired output filename WITHOUT a file ending. See example below.

.. code-block:: console

 gen_intake_gfdl.py /archive/am5/am5/am5f3b1r0/c96L65_am5f3b1r0_pdclim1850F/gfdl.ncrc5-deploy-prod-openmp/pp $HOME/catalog

This would create a catalog.csv and catalog.json in the user's home directory.

From Jupyter Notebook
---------------------

Refer to this `notebook <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder/blob/main/scripts/gen_intake_gfdl_notebook.ipynb>`_ to see how you can generate catalogs from a Jupyter Notebook

  :alt: Screenshot of a notebook showing catalog generation

You may also run a simple `python script <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder/blob/main/scripts/gen_intake_gfdl_runner.py>`_ and generate the catalogs.
`Here <https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL/CatalogBuilder/blob/main/scripts/gen_intake_gfdl_runner_config.py>`_ is another example of a runner script that uses a configuration file. 


.. code-block:: console

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  from scripts import gen_intake_gfdl
  import sys
  input_path = "/archive/am5/am5/am5f3b1r0/c96L65_am5f3b1r0_pdclim1850F/gfdl.ncrc5-deploy-prod-openmp/pp/"
  output_path = "$HOME/catalog"
  sys.argv = ['INPUT_PATH', input_path, output_path]
  print(sys.argv)
  gen_intake_gfdl.main()

Using FRE-CLI (GFDL only)
-------------------------

**1. Activate conda environment**

.. code-block:: console

 conda activate /nbhome/fms/conda/envs/fre-cli

**2. Call the builder**

Catalogs are generated by the following command: *fre catalog buildcatalog <INPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>*

(OUTPUT_PATH should end with the desired output filename WITHOUT a file ending) See example below.

.. code-block:: console

 fre catalog buildcatalog --overwrite /archive/path_to_data_dir ~/output


See `Flags`_ here.


Optional Configuration
----------------------

If you want to work with datasets and directories that are *not quite* GFDL post-processed directory oriented: 

Catalog headers (column names) are set with the *HEADER LIST* variable. The *OUTPUT PATH TEMPLATE* variable controls the expected directory structure of input data. Both can be configured by editing intakebuilder/builderconfig.py.

.. code-block:: python
   
 #Catalog Headers


 #The headerlist is expected column names in your catalog/csv file. This is usually determined by the users in conjuction
 #with the ESM collection specification standards and the appropriate workflows.

 headerlist = ["activity_id", "institution_id", "source_id", "experiment_id",
                   "frequency", "modeling_realm", "table_id",
                   "member_id", "grid_label", "variable_id",
                   "temporal_subset", "chunk_freq","grid_label","platform","dimensions","cell_methods","path"]


 #Expected Directory Structure
 
 #For a directory structure like /archive/am5/am5/am5f3b1r0/c96L65_am5f3b1r0_pdclim1850F/gfdl.ncrc5-deploy-prod-openmp/pp the output_path_template is set as follows:

 #We have NA in values that do not match up with any of the expected headerlist (CSV columns), otherwise we simply specify the associated header name in the appropriate place. E.g. The third directory in the PP path example above is the model (source_id), so the third list value in output_path_template is set to 'source_id'. We make sure this is a valid value in headerlist as well.

 #The fourth directory is am5f3b1r0 which does not map to an existing header value. So we simply set NA in output_path_template for the fourth value.

 output_path_template = ['NA','NA','source_id','NA','experiment_id','platform','custom_pp','modeling_realm','cell_methods','frequency','chunk_freq']

 output_file_template = ['modeling_realm','temporal_subset','variable_id']
